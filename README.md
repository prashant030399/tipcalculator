A tip calculator in JavaScript is a straightforward yet practical application that helps users determine the appropriate tip amount based on their bill total and desired tip percentage. The user interface typically consists of an input field for the bill amount, another input field or slider to select the tip percentage, and a button to calculate the tip. Additionally, there may be an option to input the number of people to split the bill among, which helps in calculating the per-person cost.

Upon entering the bill amount and selecting the tip percentage, the user clicks the "Calculate" button. JavaScript then takes these inputs, converts them to numerical values, and performs the necessary calculations. The tip amount is computed by multiplying the bill amount by the tip percentage (converted to a decimal). If the bill is being split, the total amount (bill plus tip) is divided by the number of people, yielding the per-person cost.

The results are dynamically displayed on the webpage, often using the innerHTML property of a designated element. This provides instant feedback to the user, making it easy to understand the financial details of their dining experience. The simplicity and utility of a tip calculator make it an excellent project for beginners to practice JavaScript and basic web development skills.
